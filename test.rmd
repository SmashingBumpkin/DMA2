## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

PLANTS GO HERE NOW BTCH

```{r plants, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data.frame(x = iris$Sepal.Length), aes(x = x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dnorm, args = list(mean = mean(iris$Sepal.Length), sd = sd(iris$Sepal.Length)), color = "blue") +
  labs(title = "PDF", x = "Sepal Length", y = "Density")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
